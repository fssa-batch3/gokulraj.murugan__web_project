                <p>Nowadays, the global economy is moving toward the digital world, and from investments to money
                    transfer,
                    everything is becoming digital. Here, the newest and most promising digital payment system has come

                    the market, which is cryptocurrency. In this topic, we will understand what exactly cryptocurrency
                    is,

                <h3>Cryptocurrency definition</h3>

                <p>Cryptocurrency, also known as crypto, is a type of online payment method that can be exchanged online
                    to purchase goods and services. It is much similar to real-world currency, but it does not have any
                    physical appearance. It is encrypted, transparent, and decentralized digital money, which is based
                    on blockchain technology. There are approximately 5000 different types of cryptocurrencies, among
                    which Bitcoin and Ethereum are the popular ones.
                </p>

                <h1>Advantages of Cryptocurrency</h1>

                <p>Last several years, cryptocurrencies are being more popular among the public because of their several
                    advantages over paper money. Some of these advantages are given below:
                </p>

                <div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 60px;">
                    <h5>1. Fraud-Proof</h5>

                    <p>One of the important advantages of cryptocurrency is that it is fraud-proof. When a
                        cryptocurrency is
                        created, all the user's confirmed transactions are saved in the public ledger. The identity of
                        coin
                        owners is kept encrypted. Hence there is no chance for a fraudulent transaction.
                    </p>


                    <h5>2. User ownership</h5>

                    <p>Since the cryptocurrency is decentralized, the user owns it. No, any government or bank has any
                        control over it. There is also not any electronic cash system.
                    </p>

                    <h5>3. Easy transaction</h5>

                    <p>In the traditional economy system, for doing any type of business or deal, there is always a lot
                        of
                        transaction fees applicable that we need to pay for each transaction. Apart from this, there are
                        also various paper works, brokerage fees, commissions, etc., users need to pay. But when we use
                        cryptocurrency, all these things are removed; as for any transaction, there is no middle man.
                        Every
                        transaction is performed between one to one within a secured network. This one-to-one
                        transaction
                        makes it easier and more transparent than the traditional one.
                    </p>


                    <h5>4. Confidential Transactions</h5>

                    <p>When we perform any transaction in a traditional transaction system with either cash or credit,
                        each transaction is recorded in our bank history. It means each transaction data remains with
                        banks.

                        In cryptocurrency, every transaction with the recipients would be unique. The information is
                        exchanged on the basis of the push concept. It means we are allowed to share only that
                        information that we want to disclose to the recipients.
                    </p>


                    <h5>5. Instant Settlement</h5>

                    <p>The easy use of cryptocurrency is making it more popular among people. For starting any
                        transaction, we just need a smart device such as a Mobile phone, internet connection, and
                        instantly we will become our own bank to make online payments and transactions.
                    </p>
